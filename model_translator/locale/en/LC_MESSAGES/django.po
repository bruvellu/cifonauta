"O sufilo Cephalochordata é representado por animais pequenos (até 6 cm de "
"comprimento), caracterizados pela presença da notocorda, uma estrutura "
"esquelética longitudinal. Possuem um plano corporal muito semelhante ao dos "
"peixes, que inclui também um sistema digestivo situado ventralmente e "
"envolvido lateralmente pela musculatura segmentar do tronco, organizada em "
"forma de “V”. São animais exclusivamente marinhos que ocorrem desde os polos "
"até o equador, em fundos arenosos usualmente rasos. As cerca de 30 espécies "
"viventes são agrupadas em três gêneros. Os adultos permanecem com a parte "
"posterior do corpo enterrada no sedimento, ficando a região anterior livre "
"para filtrar água e, assim, obter alimento (geralmente fitoplâncton). Podem "
"nadar, mas raramente o fazem."

"The subphylum Cephalochordata (called vernacularly as lancelets) is "
"represented by a small (up to 6 cm long) animals characterized to have the "
"notochord as an axial organ throughout the whole body length. The lancelet "
"body plan is similar to that of fishes and other vertebrates: dorsally-"
"situated neural tube, and ventrally-situated alimentary system sandwiched "
"laterally with myotomes (or myomeres), arranged as a series of segmented "
"muscle blocks on each side. They are exclusively marine, inhabiting "
"intertidal to subtidal sandy bottoms in boreal to tropical waters around the "
"world. Recently, however, the true deep-sea species was firstly described. "
"The adults have at benthic life within the superficial layer of bottom "
"sediment, and are filter-feeders. Adults can also swim, but only rarely and "
"sporadically."

"<p>Inserida em uma das mais belas e turísticas regiões litorâneas do país – "

"SP), além de conter remanescentes de manguezal e de abrigar alta diversidade "
"biológica, é também um verdadeiro laboratório a céu aberto e um importante "
"reduto de catadores de moluscos e pescadores artesanais.</p><p>Considerada "
"área natural de expansão do porto, por pouco o Araçá não desapareceu da "
"paisagem de São Sebastião. Em 1987, o aterro da baía, previsto no plano "
"diretor do porto, foi evitado por pressão de ambientalistas e da comunidade "
"científica. Um ano depois, a baía foi secionada por uma desastrosa dragagem "
"para assentamento de um emissário submarino da SABESP, o que provocou danos "
"ecológicos profundos: destruição de habitats e mortandade de organismos. Há "
"vinte anos, o esgoto gerado na região central do município é despejado nas "
"proximidades do Araçá por meio desse emissário que, curiosamente, permanece "
"sem licenciamento ambiental. A tudo isso soma-se a urbanização desordenada, "
"que se encarrega de descaracterizar suas margens e despejar mais lixo e "
"esgoto. Por fim, em 2008, a intenção de aterrar o restante da Baía do Araçá "
"foi anunciada novamente, desta vez no Plano de Desenvolvimento do Porto de "
"São Sebastião, gerido pela Companhia Docas.</p><p>Contudo, este aparente "
"futuro lúgubre não poderia ser mais impróprio. Apesar de poluído e "
"empobrecido, o Araçá insiste em dar mostras de vitalidade. Espécies marinhas "
"que haviam desaparecido em conseqüência da dragagem reapareceram anos após o "
"crime ecológico impune. Garças e colhereiros são vistos com mais freqüência "
"nas águas rasas e lamacentas da baía.</p><p>Embora longe da condição "
"prístina que em parte motivou a criação do CEBIMar na década de 1950, o "
"Araçá continua objeto de estudo e ensino. É um dos mais peculiares ambientes "
"marinhos do litoral – um dos poucos manguezais do canal, onde vivem "
"organismos raramente representados em outros locais. São 733 espécies "
"registradas para a área das quais 34 foram descritas como novas para a "
"ciência; muitas ainda não foram encontradas em outras localidades. Na lista "
"ainda existem espécies de poliquetas, equinodermos e hemicordados ameaçadas "
"de extinção. Por ser uma região de mangue, diversas espécies marinhas passam "
"parte de seu ciclo de vida no local como crustáceos e peixes.</p><p>O Araçá "
"também abriga espécies que servem de recursos naturais como moluscos, "
"camarões e peixes. Pescadores artesanais e catadores de mariscos e siris "
"usufruem da baía nos dias de marés suficientemente baixas e comercializam os "
"produtos em feiras livres, além de consumo próprio.</p><p>Os dados "
"científicos acumulados em mais de 50 anos de pesquisa e os depoimentos da "
"comunidade revelam o quanto a conservação dessa região representa para a "
"Ciência e para a vida de quem dela depende. Nesse sentido, é inquestionável "
"a necessidade premente de se proteger as espécies que teimam em manter a "
"preciosa riqueza da Baía do Araçá.</p><p>Com o aterro do Araçá, além de "
"destruir este complexo ecossistema, os danos ecológicos não ficariam "
"restritos à região. A retificação da linha da costa afetará a dinâmica de "
"sedimentação no canal, possivelmente causando assoreamento ou erosão nas "
"praias e costões adjacentes. A possível e desejada relação entre turismo "
"sustentado e ambiente dificilmente floresce em zonas portuárias e "
"industriais. São Sebastião tem a responsabilidade de manter íntegro o frágil "
"patrimônio ambiental sob sua tutela, para usufruto desta e das gerações "

"<p>The Araçá Bay (São Sebastião, State of São Paulo), within one of Brazil’s "
"most beautiful coastlines, has small relict mangrove stands and a very "
"diverse marine ecosystem. As such, the bay is a natural laboratory as well "
"as important for local small-scale fishing.</p><p>Considered a natural area "
"for expansion of the port of São Sebastião, the Araçá bay almost disappeared "
"from the landscape. In 1987, the filling project of the bay was prevented by "
"pressure from environmentalists and the scientific community. A year later, "
"the bay was dredged for the placement of a sewage outfall, which caused "
"profound ecological damage, habitat destruction, and death of organisms. For "
"twenty years the sewage generated in the central region of the municipality "
"was dumped in the vicinity of Araçá through this outfall, which remains "
"operating without an environmental license. Moreover, the growing "
"urbanization contributes to the environmental impacts on the bay, increasing "
"the amount of waste and sewage dumped. In 2008, the threat of filling the "
"remainder of the Araçá Bay was announced again.</p><p>However, although "
"polluted and depleted, the Araçá insists to show vitality. Marine species "
"that had disappeared as a result of the dredging reappeared several years "
"after this ecological crime. Herons and spoonbills are seen more often in "
"the shallow and muddy waters of the bay.</p><p>While far from its pristine "
"condition, which partly motivated the creation of CEBIMar in the 1950s, the "
"Araçá remains a place for studying and teaching. It is one of the most "
"unique coastal marine environments - one of the few mangroves in the coast "
"of São Sebastião, which harbors high biodiversity. 733 species were recorded "
"for the area of which 34 were described as new to science, many have not "
"been found elsewhere. In the list there are endangered species of "
"polychaetes, echinoderms and hemichordates. Being a mangrove area, several "
"marine species common to the region spend part of their life cycles in the "
"bay, such as crustaceans and fish.</p><p>The Araçá is also home to species "
"that are natural resources such as mollusks, shrimps and fish. Fishermen and "
"shellfish gatherers take advantage of low tides to collect these resources "
"for their own consumption or to market them in free markets.</p><p>The "
"traditional knowledge and scientific data accumulated in more than 50 years "
"of research show how the conservation of this region is important for "
"science and for the lives of all who depend on it. Thus, there is an "
"unquestionable need to protect species that insist on keeping the precious "
"wealth of the bay of Araçá.</p><p>The reclamation of Araçá will not only "
"destroy this complex ecosystem, the ecological damage will certainly not be "
"restricted to the region. The rectification of the coastline will affect the "
"dynamics of sedimentation in the channel, possibly causing siltation or "
"erosion on nearby beaches. The desired sustainable relationship between "
"tourism and environment rarely blooms in ports and industrial areas. São "
"Sebastião has the responsibility to keep safe this fragile environmental "

"de água do mar pode conter dezenas de milhares desses pequenos organismos. "
"Muitos deles são produtores primários, isto é, realizam fotossíntese, e são "
"denominados de <em>fitoplâncton</em>. Os fitoplanctontes, que incluem vários "
"grupos de \"microalgas\", vivem apenas nas camadas superiores e iluminadas "
"dos oceanos. Produzem grande parte do oxigênio atmosférico, além de servir "
"como alimento para uma parcela do plâncton incapaz de obter energia "
"diretamente da luz do sol e que depende deles para sobreviver, o "
"<em>zooplâncton</em>. </p><p>Além de se alimentarem de fitoplâncton, as "
"espécies de zooplâncton podem consumir bactérias e material orgânico "
"particulado. E, por sua vez, servem de alimento para organismos maiores, "
"incluindo outras espécies de zooplâncton, peixes e até baleias.</p><p>Muitos "
"organismos passam todo o seu ciclo de vida no plâncton, como os unicelulares "
"e espécies de invertebrados: copépodes, moluscos, crustáceos, poliquetas "
"etc. Mas a comunidade planctônica é composta também pelas larvas de "
"invertebrados e de certos peixes, cujos adultos habitam o fundo do mar ou a "
"coluna de água (veja o tour <a href=\"/web/20130606133023/http://cifonauta."

"acostumados. Nesse meio, a força da viscosidade da água impera sobre os seus "
"corpos microscópicos, que têm \"dificuldade\" para se deslocar. Para "
"entender melhor esse fenômeno, imagine-se em uma piscina de melado, onde só "
"é possível nadar ou mexer qualquer parte de seu corpo em câmara lenta. É "
"neste tipo de ambiente que os organismos planctônicos obtêm alimento e se "

"<p>Although generally small in size, planktonic beings are giants in "
"stature. Basis of marine food chains, the plankton (Greek <em>planktos</em>, "
"drifting) comprises a great diversity of uni- and multicellular organisms "
"that live dispersed in water. This community is largely less than 0.01 mm to "
"a few centimeters, but there are notable exceptions such as jellyfish and "
"the Portuguese man-of-war, which tentacles can reach meters in length. Many "
"swim well, but not enough to overcome the force of water. Therefore, they "
"roam freely, being transported by marine currents.</p><p>In addition to "
"being small, planktonic organisms are also transparent or translucent, and "
"easily overlooked ― examining them requires the use of microscopes and "
"special collecting devices, as several kinds of plankton nets. However, they "
"are very abundant and reproduce with incredible speed. One liter of seawater "
"can contain tens of thousands of these small organisms. Many of them are "
"primary producers, i.e., perform photosynthesis, and are called "
"<em>phytoplankton</em>. The phytoplankton, which includes several groups of "
"&quot;microalgae&quot; that live only in the well-lit upper layer of oceans "
"water, produces much of the atmospheric oxygen, and serve as food for a "
"portion of the plankton unable to get energy directly from sunlight and that "
"depends on it for survival, the <em>zooplankton</em>.</p><p>Besides feeding "
"on phytoplankton, zooplankton species can consume bacteria and particulate "
"organic matter. And, in turn, they serve as food for larger organisms, "
"including other species of zooplankton, fish and even whales.</p><p>Many "
"organisms spend all their life cycle in the plankton, such as both "
"unicellular and invertebrate species: copepods, mollusks, crustaceans, "
"polychaetes, etc. But the plankton community is also composed by the larvae "
"of invertebrates and some fish whose adults inhabit the seabed or the water "
"column (see the tour <a href=\"/tour/larvas-marinhas/\">Marine larvae</a>).</"
"p><p>The plankters live in a physically different world than ours. In their "
"environment, viscous forces prevail over their microscopic bodies, which "
"have &quot;difficulty&quot; moving. To better understand this phenomenon, "
"imagine yourself in a pool of molasses, in which it is only possible to swim "
"or move any part of your body in slow motion. It is in this kind of "
"environment that planktonic organisms obtain food and reproduce for millions "
"of years.</p>"
