"<p>Inserida em uma das mais belas e turísticas regiões litorâneas do país – "
"o Litoral Norte do Estado de São Paulo –, a Baía do Araçá (São Sebastião, "
"SP), além de conter remanescentes de manguezal e de abrigar alta diversidade"
" biológica, é também um verdadeiro laboratório a céu aberto e um importante "
"reduto de catadores de moluscos e pescadores artesanais.</p><p>Considerada "
"área natural de expansão do porto, por pouco o Araçá não desapareceu da "
"paisagem de São Sebastião. Em 1987, o aterro da baía, previsto no plano "
"diretor do porto, foi evitado por pressão de ambientalistas e da comunidade "
"científica. Um ano depois, a baía foi secionada por uma desastrosa dragagem "
"para assentamento de um emissário submarino da SABESP, o que provocou danos "
"ecológicos profundos: destruição de habitats e mortandade de organismos. Há "
"vinte anos, o esgoto gerado na região central do município é despejado nas "
"proximidades do Araçá por meio desse emissário que, curiosamente, permanece "
"sem licenciamento ambiental. A tudo isso soma-se a urbanização desordenada, "
"que se encarrega de descaracterizar suas margens e despejar mais lixo e "
"esgoto. Por fim, em 2008, a intenção de aterrar o restante da Baía do Araçá "
"foi anunciada novamente, desta vez no Plano de Desenvolvimento do Porto de "
"São Sebastião, gerido pela Companhia Docas.</p><p>Contudo, este aparente "
"futuro lúgubre não poderia ser mais impróprio. Apesar de poluído e "
"empobrecido, o Araçá insiste em dar mostras de vitalidade. Espécies marinhas"
" que haviam desaparecido em conseqüência da dragagem reapareceram anos após "
"o crime ecológico impune. Garças e colhereiros são vistos com mais "
"freqüência nas águas rasas e lamacentas da baía.</p><p>Embora longe da "
"condição prístina que em parte motivou a criação do CEBIMar na década de "
"1950, o Araçá continua objeto de estudo e ensino. É um dos mais peculiares "
"ambientes marinhos do litoral – um dos poucos manguezais do canal, onde "
"vivem organismos raramente representados em outros locais. São 733 espécies "
"registradas para a área das quais 34 foram descritas como novas para a "
"ciência; muitas ainda não foram encontradas em outras localidades. Na lista "
"ainda existem espécies de poliquetas, equinodermos e hemicordados ameaçadas "
"de extinção. Por ser uma região de mangue, diversas espécies marinhas passam"
" parte de seu ciclo de vida no local como crustáceos e peixes.</p><p>O Araçá"
" também abriga espécies que servem de recursos naturais como moluscos, "
"camarões e peixes. Pescadores artesanais e catadores de mariscos e siris "
"usufruem da baía nos dias de marés suficientemente baixas e comercializam os"
" produtos em feiras livres, além de consumo próprio.</p><p>Os dados "
"científicos acumulados em mais de 50 anos de pesquisa e os depoimentos da "
"comunidade revelam o quanto a conservação dessa região representa para a "
"Ciência e para a vida de quem dela depende. Nesse sentido, é inquestionável "
"a necessidade premente de se proteger as espécies que teimam em manter a "
"preciosa riqueza da Baía do Araçá.</p><p>Com o aterro do Araçá, além de "
"destruir este complexo ecossistema, os danos ecológicos não ficariam "
"restritos à região. A retificação da linha da costa afetará a dinâmica de "
"sedimentação no canal, possivelmente causando assoreamento ou erosão nas "
"praias e costões adjacentes. A possível e desejada relação entre turismo "
"sustentado e ambiente dificilmente floresce em zonas portuárias e "
"industriais. São Sebastião tem a responsabilidade de manter íntegro o frágil"
" patrimônio ambiental sob sua tutela, para usufruto desta e das gerações "
"futuras.</p>"

"<p>The Araçá Bay (São Sebastião, State of São Paulo), within one of Brazil’s"
" most beautiful coastlines, has small relict mangrove stands and a very "
"diverse marine ecosystem. As such, the bay is a natural laboratory as well "
"as important for local small-scale fishing.</p><p>Considered a natural area "
"for expansion of the port of São Sebastião, the Araçá bay almost disappeared"
" from the landscape. In 1987, the filling project of the bay was prevented "
"by pressure from environmentalists and the scientific community. A year "
"later, the bay was dredged for the placement of a sewage outfall, which "
"caused profound ecological damage, habitat destruction, and death of "
"organisms. For twenty years the sewage generated in the central region of "
"the municipality was dumped in the vicinity of Araçá through this outfall, "
"which remains operating without an environmental license. Moreover, the "
"growing urbanization contributes to the environmental impacts on the bay, "
"increasing the amount of waste and sewage dumped. In 2008, the threat of "
"filling the remainder of the Araçá Bay was announced again.</p><p>However, "
"although polluted and depleted, the Araçá insists to show vitality. Marine "
"species that had disappeared as a result of the dredging reappeared several "
"years after this ecological crime. Herons and spoonbills are seen more often"
" in the shallow and muddy waters of the bay.</p><p>While far from its "
"pristine condition, which partly motivated the creation of CEBIMar in the "
"1950s, the Araçá remains a place for studying and teaching. It is one of the"
" most unique coastal marine environments - one of the few mangroves in the "
"coast of São Sebastião, which harbors high biodiversity. 733 species were "
"recorded for the area of which 34 were described as new to science, many "
"have not been found elsewhere. In the list there are endangered species of "
"polychaetes, echinoderms and hemichordates. Being a mangrove area, several "
"marine species common to the region spend part of their life cycles in the "
"bay, such as crustaceans and fish.</p><p>The Araçá is also home to species "
"that are natural resources such as mollusks, shrimps and fish. Fishermen and"
" shellfish gatherers take advantage of low tides to collect these resources "
"for their own consumption or to market them in free markets.</p><p>The "
"traditional knowledge and scientific data accumulated in more than 50 years "
"of research show how the conservation of this region is important for "
"science and for the lives of all who depend on it. Thus, there is an "
"unquestionable need to protect species that insist on keeping the precious "
"wealth of the bay of Araçá.</p><p>The reclamation of Araçá will not only "
"destroy this complex ecosystem, the ecological damage will certainly not be "
"restricted to the region. The rectification of the coastline will affect the"
" dynamics of sedimentation in the channel, possibly causing siltation or "
"erosion on nearby beaches. The desired sustainable relationship between "
"tourism and environment rarely blooms in ports and industrial areas. São "
"Sebastião has the responsibility to keep safe this fragile environmental "
"heritage for the enjoyment of this and future generations.</p>"

"<p>Although generally small in size, planktonic beings are giants in "
"stature. Basis of marine food chains, the plankton (Greek <em>planktos</em>,"
" drifting) comprises a great diversity of uni- and multicellular organisms "
"that live dispersed in water. This community is largely less than 0.01 mm to"
" a few centimeters, but there are notable exceptions such as jellyfish and "
"the Portuguese man-of-war, which tentacles can reach meters in length. Many "
"swim well, but not enough to overcome the force of water. Therefore, they "
"roam freely, being transported by marine currents.</p><p>In addition to "
"being small, planktonic organisms are also transparent or translucent, and "
"easily overlooked ― examining them requires the use of microscopes and "
"special collecting devices, as several kinds of plankton nets. However, they"
" are very abundant and reproduce with incredible speed. One liter of "
"seawater can contain tens of thousands of these small organisms. Many of "
"them are primary producers, i.e., perform photosynthesis, and are called "
"<em>phytoplankton</em>. The phytoplankton, which includes several groups of "
"&quot;microalgae&quot; that live only in the well-lit upper layer of oceans "
"water, produces much of the atmospheric oxygen, and serve as food for a "
"portion of the plankton unable to get energy directly from sunlight and that"

" on phytoplankton, zooplankton species can consume bacteria and particulate "
"organic matter. And, in turn, they serve as food for larger organisms, "
"including other species of zooplankton, fish and even whales.</p><p>Many "
"organisms spend all their life cycle in the plankton, such as both "
"unicellular and invertebrate species: copepods, mollusks, crustaceans, "
"polychaetes, etc. But the plankton community is also composed by the larvae "

"column (see the tour <a href=\"/tour/larvas-marinhas/\">Marine "
